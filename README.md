Situational awareness underpins informed decisions. Understanding what comprises a network, and what network elements are doing is essential.  Without situational awareness and context, defending a network remains a difficult proposition.

Can SDN and machine learning answer:
- What devices comprise my network?
- What are devices doing?

# Getting Started

Nothing to see here yet, move along...

# Install Instructions

```
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
git clone https://github.com/Lab41/poseidon.git
cd poseidon
make
```

If installing from a clean machine, a startup.sh script resides in the repo that can be used to 
install docker and docker-compose for an Ubunut 16.04 box. Make this script executable and then 
run with `sudo ./startup.sh`.

# Required Dependencies

- Docker
- make
- docker-compose
- /data/db directory for mongodb database
- The 1.8 release of docker-compose can be installed with `make compose-install`
- Update the `ip` of the `[database]` section of `config/poseidon.config` to the ip of the host machine (or
the `docker-machine ip` if using boot2docker or similar). NOTE: without this configuration, poseidon will fail to build.

# Usage Examples

```
make compose
```

# Documentation
- [Docs](https://github.com/Lab41/poseidon/tree/master/docs)

# Tests

Tests are currently written in py.test for Python.  The tests are automatically run when building the dockerfile.

They can also be tested using:
```
make test
```
