Situational awareness underpins informed decisions. Understanding what comprises a network, and what network elements are doing is essential.  Without situational awareness and context, defending a network remains a difficult proposition.

Can SDN and machine learning answer:
- What devices comprise my network?
- What are devices doing?

# Install Instructions

```
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
git clone https://github.com/Lab41/poseidon.git
cd poseidon
*editor* config/poseidon.config
make compose
```

# Configuration
## docker-compose.yaml
- `/data/db` directory for mongodb database; you can use a different directory by updating the `docker-compose.yaml`
- under the `storage` section, update `volumes` to `/path/to/your/dir:/data/db` with the path to the directory to store mongodb records.

## config/poseidon.config
### PoseidonStorage
- Under the `[PoseidonStorage]` section, update the following:
- `database` to the external ip of the host machine running mongodb (or
the `docker-machine ip` if using boot2docker or similar - making sure that write-persistent volumes can be mounted). NOTE: without this configuration, poseidon will fail to build.

### PoseidonMain
- Under `[PoseidonMain]` section, update the following:
- `database` to the name of the database storing the network graph documents (default is `poseidon_records`)
- `collection` to the name of the collection storing the network graph documents (default is `netgraph_beta)
- `collector_nic` to the nic on the machine running vent that is configured with the controller to capture traffic
- `collector_interval` to the collection interval in seconds (default is `30` for a capture length of 30 seconds)
- `collector_filter` to limit what gets captured off the controller (default is empty string for no filters, see the collector documentation for details)
- `vent_ip` to the ip of the box running the vent collector
- `vent_port` to the external port of the nfilter vent container
- `storage_interface_ip` to the external ip of the poseidon-storage-interface container (NOTE: this should be the same as the `database` field of `PoseidonStorage`, unlesss the storage-interface container is being run on a different machine)
- `storage_interface_port` to the external port of the poseidon-storage-interface container only if changed from the default of `28000`

### Controller
- Update the `controller_uri` ip address, `contrller_user`, `controller_pass` of the `[NorthBoundControllerAbstraction:Handle_Periodic]` section. NOTE: without this configuration, poseidon will not be able to talk to the controller


# Required Dependencies

- Docker (If installing from a clean machine, a startup.sh script resides in the repo that can be used to
install docker and docker-compose for an Ubunut 16.04 box. Make this script executable and then
run with `sudo ./startup.sh`.)
- make
- docker-compose (the 1.8 release of docker-compose can be installed with `make compose-install`)


# Documentation
- [Docs](https://github.com/Lab41/poseidon/tree/master/docs)

# Tests

Tests are currently written in py.test for Python.  The tests are automatically run when building the containers.

They can also be tested using:
```
make test
```
